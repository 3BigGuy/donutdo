Iâ€™m Tania Rascia, a web developer, technical writer, and former chef from Chicago. I currently work as a front end software engineer for a startup, and I've written for many developer publications.

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while going through a career change. I learn in public and write about everything I know.

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.
